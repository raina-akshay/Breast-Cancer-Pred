# Comparative Analysis of Different Machine Learning Classification Algorithms for Breast Cancer Prediction
### In Dev!

This is a Python- based implementation of Different Classification Algorithms on the task of Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning.
## About Dataset:
Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))

#### [Data Set Information](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)#:~:text=Data%20Set%20Information%3A,cd%20math%2Dprog%2Fcpo%2Ddataset%2Fmachine%2Dlearn%2FWDBC%2F)

#### Attribute Information:
1. ID number
2. Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
##### Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus(3-32):
- radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
- texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- perimeter
- area
- smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
- concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
- concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
- symmetry
- fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
